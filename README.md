# Insertion-Sorting-Technique-

1.A collection of elements can be sorted in ascending or descending order using the process known as insertion sort. The algorithm's fundamental concept is to split the list into two sections: an unsorted section and a sorted section.

2.Only the first member of the list is initially present in the sorted section; the remaining elements are present in the unsorted part. The algorithm then selects one element at a time from the unsorted part of the data during each iteration and places it in the appropriate spot in the sorted section.

3.Starting with the rightmost element, the method compares the current element to each element in the sorted portion. Until it encounters an element that is either smaller (if sorting in ascending order) or bigger (if sorting in descending order) than the current element, it keeps moving to the left.

4.Once the suitable position has been identified, the algorithm moves every other element to the right of it to make room for the present element before inserting it into the right place.

5.A completely sorted list is obtained when this procedure is repeated until all the elements in the unsorted portion have been moved to the appropriate locations in the sorted part.

6.Because insertion sort uses an in-place sorting algorithm and just needs the original list as storage, it has the benefit of not requiring any more space. Additionally, it is suitable for small datasets but not for big ones due to its temporal complexity of O(n2).

7.In conclusion, insertion sort is a straightforward yet efficient sorting algorithm that may be used to small datasets or included in more intricate algorithms.

Characteristics of Insertion Sort:

a.Insertion Sort features include simplicity of implementation and one of the simplest algorithms.

b.For modest data values, insertion sort is often effective.

c. Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, hence it is suitable for data sets that have previously undergone some degree of sorting.
